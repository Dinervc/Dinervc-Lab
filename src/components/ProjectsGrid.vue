            <h2>Information</h2>
            <p>I started all of these projects within the last three years. Some were for a school project, some
                were for my personal education and a few were created as a mix of both. They clearly outline just how far
                I've come in less than three years of my computer science school. If I had to pick one, my most favorite one
                is "Reflectory", for somewhat obvious reasons.</p>
